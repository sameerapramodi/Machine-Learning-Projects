        "An unbalanced dataset is where a *class* or outcome is much less common than another: in this case, most people don't have strokes. This can lead machine learning models to tend to predict a common class (`no stroke`) over a minority/rare class (`stroke`) as it has received many more examples of one class over another and cannot learn what differentiates the two.\n",

        "There are various ways of approaching unbalanced datasets like these, which we will explore now:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Get more data\n",
        "In an ideal world, we could simply collect more data representing the *minority* class. However, this is not always easy or feasible. For example, we would have to wait many months or years to collect lots of data for strokes,!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Weighting/Model penalization\n",
        "We can 'penalize' our model to put greater weight on a minority class. This forces the model to pay more attention to the minority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Resampling\n",
        "Resampling is essentially manipulating our dataset so there is a ratio of classes closer to 50:50. There are two approaches within this:\n",
        " 1. **Undersampling** - where we take a sample (either randomly or through more intelligent means) of the **majority** class to limit the ratio.\n",
